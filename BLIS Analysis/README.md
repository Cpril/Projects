# BLIS Analysis

**BLIS (Basic Literacy in Statistics) assessment** is a test developed by Dr Ziegler “for students in an introductory statistics course, at the post-secondary level, that includes … simulation-based methods.” It focuses on statistical literacy.

For the past several years, Calvin University statistics students have completed Ziegler’s BLIS assessment near the start and end of the course. The data file included in the folder. This analysis uses **programming language R** to analyze the BLIS assessment scores, investigating whether students have higher statistical literacy scores after taking Statistic classes. Dataset includes 293 rows and 4 variables: 
- *Timepoint*: “pre” (start of semester) or “Post” (end of semester)
- *Percent*: score on the BLIS assessment, as a percentage
- *Duration*: time the student took to complete the BLIS, in minutes
- *Course*: the course that the student took or will take
