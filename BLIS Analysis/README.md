# BLIS Analysis

**BLIS (Basic Literacy in Statistics) assessment** is a test developed by Dr Ziegler “for students in an introductory statistics course, at the post-secondary level, that includes … simulation-based methods.” It focuses on statistical literacy.

For the past several years, Calvin University statistics students have completed Ziegler’s BLIS assessment near the start and end of the course. The data file included in the folder. This analysis uses programming language R to analyze the BLIS assessment scores, investigating whether students have higher statistical literacy scores after taking Statistic classes.
Variables in dataset includes:
- Timepoint: “pre” (start of semester) or “Post” (end of semester)
- Percent: score on the BLIS assessment, as a percentage
- Duration: time the student took to complete the BLIS, in minutes
- Course the student took at Calvin (for example, STAT 145 or STAT 243)
